# Tree-Classification-Week-02
Tree Classification project using a Convolutional Neural Network built with Keras. Includes a pre-trained model (tree_model.h5) and training code (Week_2.ipynb). Classifies tree species from images with good accuracy. Implemented data augmentation and optimization techniques. Easy to load and use for predictions or further training.
