🌳 Tree Classification using Deep Learning
This project focuses on classifying tree species using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The trained model is saved as tree_model.h5 and can be used to predict tree types from input images.

📁 Files Included
Week_2.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for training, evaluating, and testing the model.

tree_model.h5: Pre-trained Keras model file for classifying tree species.

🧠 Model Details
Architecture: CNN (custom or based on a pre-trained model like VGG/ResNet)

Dataset: Tree image dataset (public or custom collected)

Framework: TensorFlow / Keras

Accuracy: Achieved XX% validation accuracy (edit based on your results)

🛠️ How to Use
python
Copy
Edit
# Load model
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('tree_model.h5')

# Predict from image
prediction = model.predict(preprocessed_image)
📈 Improvements Done
Enhanced accuracy through image augmentation and dropout layers.

Optimized model with early stopping and batch normalization.

Clean and modular Jupyter notebook for experimentation.
